# MeArm

## Introduction
The [MeArm](http://learn.mime.co.uk/docs/building-the-mearm-deluxe/) is an open-source robotic arm with 3 axis of movement (up/down, forward/back, right/left) and a gripping claw. You can download the build instructions and the cutting design files for laser cutting the pieces on their website.

## Building a MeArm
I built a MeArm using a laser cutter to cut the pieces of the arm in 3mm acrylic. I ordered four mini servo motors on [Banggood](www.banggood.com): specifically, I ordered four Towerpro MG91 13g 2.6KG Torque Metal Gear Digital Servos. I also bought various lengths of M3 bolts. The MeArm is controlled with an Arduino Mini and a breakout board.

## Controlling the MeArm
Marc built a custom controller using two thumb joysticks that were recovered from an old PS1 controller.
